Environment:
  Name: Bombs
  Description: |
    This environment tests
    * Objects can be spawn underneath the agent
    * Objects can spawn other object repeatedly in directions in single time-steps
    * Objects can be removed with delayed actions
    * Custom Action Ids with custom VectorToDests can be used to propagate further actions on spawns
  Player:
    AvatarObject: bomber # The player can only control a single avatar in the game
