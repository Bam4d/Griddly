# Mechanics Integration Tests

The mechanics integration tests here make sure that future updates do not break simple important mechanics.
These tests also make sure that the examples in the python project are working.

These tests do:
 * Provide a list of environments with specific mechanics
 * These specific mechanics are important to keep working in future updates
 * Prove that the specific mechanics are not broken.
 * Check that state information is as-expected during state transitions

These tests do not:
 * Check rendering of environments
