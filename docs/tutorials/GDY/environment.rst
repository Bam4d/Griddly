Environment
###########

The ``Environment`` configuration contains the definition of how the game will be controlled by the player, the conditions underwhich the game ends, the configurations of observers and the levels that are contained in the game.

*****************************
Step 1 - Player Configuration
*****************************

The ``Player`` configuration 

.. code-block:: YAML

    Player:
      AvatarObject: avatar 


*******************************
Step 2 - Termination Conditions
*******************************

Termination conditions are the rules which decide when the game episodes are complete, and whether the agent wins or loses.

Rules can be defined seperately for ``Win`` and ``Lose``. In Sokoban, the player "wins" by pushing all of the boxes into holes. This is how it is defined in GDY.

.. code-block:: YAML

    Termination:
        Win:
          - eq: [box:count, 0]

We define here that the agent wins in the case that the number of ``box`` objects in the environment reaches 0. The ``:count`` attribute can be appended to any object name to return the number of those objects. 

***************
Step 3 - Levels
***************

In our Sokoban game we are going to define two levels. The layout of each level is defined by a level string which is made up of ``MapCharacter`` characters that are defined in the :ref:`Objects <doc_tutorials_gdy_objects>` section of this tutorial.

the dot ``.`` character means that the space in the map in unoccupied.

.. code-block:: YAML

    Levels:
        - |
          wwwwwww
          w..hA.w
          w.whw.w
          w...b.w
          whbb.ww
          w..wwww
          wwwwwww
        - |
          wwwwwwwww
          ww.h....w
          ww...bA.w
          w....w..w
          wwwbw...w
          www...w.w
          wwwh....w
          wwwwwwwww

the two defined levels will look like this when rendered:

.. image:: img/getting-started-level-0.png
.. image:: img/getting-started-level-1.png


********************************************
Step 4 - TileSize and Background Image
********************************************

.. code-block:: YAML 

    Observers:
      Sprite2D:
        TileSize: 24
        BackgroundTile: gvgai/newset/floor2.png
      Block2D:
        TileSize: 24

Here we specify the size of the tiles in pixels ``TileSize`` for both the Sprite2D and Block2D observers. Also if we want to use an image for the background when there are no objects present we can supply a ``BackgroundTile`` image.

***********************
Putting it all together
***********************

The environment definition with all the parts described looks like this:

.. code-block:: YAML

   Environment:
      Name: sokoban
      Observers:
      Sprite2D:
        TileSize: 24
        BackgroundTile: gvgai/newset/floor2.png
      Block2D:
        TileSize: 24
      Player:
        AvatarObject: avatar
      Termination:
        Win:
          - eq: [box:count, 0] # If there are no boxes left
      Levels:
        - |
          wwwwwww
          w..hA.w
          w.whw.w
          w...b.w
          whbb.ww
          w..wwww
          wwwwwww
        - |
          wwwwwwwww
          ww.h....w
          ww...bA.w
          w....w..w
          wwwbw...w
          www...w.w
          wwwh....w
          wwwwwwwww
