Stochasticity
#############

In this tutorial you will learn all about how to add stochasticity to environments. We will build an example environment where cows wander around a field and might eat some grass occaisionally. Your job is to replant the grass!

Additionally in this example we use some custom assets from the  `Crafter <https://github.com/danijar/crafter>`_ Reinforcement Learning environment.
